Scrollbar bug	We say that there is an horizontal scrollbar when (the page's width is less than the page's scroll-width). Always ( Not ( there is an horizontal scrollbar ) ).
Element collision	We say that $x x-intersects $y when ( (($y's right - 1) is greater than $x's left) And (($x's right - 1) is greater than $y's left) ). We say that $x y-intersects $y when ( (($y's bottom - 1) is greater than $x's top) And (($x's bottom - 1) is greater than $y's top) ). We say that $x is visible when ( Not ( $x's display is "none" ) ). We say that $x and $y are the same when ( $x's cornipickleid equals $y's cornipickleid ). We say that $x and $y are not the same when ( Not ($x and $y are the same) ). We say that $x and $y overlap when ( (($x is visible) And ($y is visible)) And ( ($x x-intersects $y) And ($x y-intersects $y) ) ). We say that $x and $y do not overlap when ( Not ($x and $y overlap) ). Always ( For each $x in $(body *) ( For each $y in $($x > *) ( For each $z in $($x > *) ( If ( ($y and $z are not the same) And ($y and $z do not overlap) ) Then ( Next ( When $y is now $a ( When $z is now $b ( $a and $b don't overlap)))))))).
